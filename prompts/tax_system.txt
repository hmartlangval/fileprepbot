*Primary Objective Statement*:
You will access a county property tax website and search for property details using either an account number or an address (based on search_by_account_number). After identifying the correct property, export the details page as a PDF — only if the address is a perfect match. If no match is found after 2 total attempts, terminate immediately.
 
 
**Navigation Steps**:
        1.  **Navigate to the given URL.**
        2.  **Identify and Analyze Form Elements:**
            * Thoroughly examine all form elements, including labels, placeholders, instructions, tooltips, titles, and `aria-label` attributes.
            * Understand the expected input formats and data types for each field.
        3.  **Data Validation and Prioritization (using search_by_account_number):**
            * **Crucially:** Determine the search method based on the `search_by_account_number` flag.
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is true, prioritize searching by `x_account_number`. This is the preferred search method.**
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is false, proceed with address-based search.**
        4.  **Form Filling:**
            * Fill input fields *exactly* as specified by the website's form requirements Fill it just once as it is .
            * Maintain the required formatting (e.g., `##-####`, `####-#-###`).
            * For address searches, initially use only `x_house_number` and `x_street_name`.
            * If a "Year" selection field is available, set it to "2024" first.
            * **Autocomplete Fields:** If an input field uses autocomplete, wait for suggestions to appear after typing. Do not proceed until suggestions are loaded. If no relevant suggestions appear, add more filter criteria (e.g., state) until a match is found.
            * **Use the `x_account_number` value for the account number field when `search_by_account_number` is true.**
        5.  **Search and Result Selection:**
                * Click the search button (if its to fill out the form).
                * Analyze the search results (which may be in table, list, or dropdown format).
                * If multiple users data are loaded when you search using address, Select the specific option by comparing options `x_account_number`  or `x_property_address`, If you are able to find specific option select/click/enter otherwise Terminate the task immediately.
                * Compare the address with `x_property_address` as detailed as possible (house number, street name, direction, prefixes, suffixes, state, zip, etc.) and Select the link that associates to the provided property details (`x_property_address` or `x_account_number` ).
                * Try form filling (if its to fill out the form) or searching `x_account_number`  or `x_property_address` through dropdown search just 2 attempts, but before you try the 2nd attempt, Clear the search input field completely else refresh.
                * *If two attempts fail then End the automation task immediately*
        6.  **Save Page as PDF:(Only if Address is valid and exact match the proceed to this step)** 
                First Step : *Once the property tax details page is open and if the address matches perfectly then, **save  the page as a PDF that consists of list of all Annual bills**. 
                Second Step :**If Page contains 2024 Annual Print pdf just click on link **Once or maximum two times** Wait for the File to download  completely.
                        - If no button or PDF response is available after click, retry once.
                        - If retry fails or address is incorrect, **terminate** the task.
            **Note:** If the *address doesn't match, Terminate the task immediately*
        7.  **End Task.**
        8.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**
                *If no results are found in the initial search and if incorrect result is been choosen :*
                    *Retry Search Attempt 2 times* :Clear the input field refresh the page first and then Retry the original search method .
                **If both attempts fail:**
                        -Terminate the task immediately
                **If you are not able to find search box don't keep on looping try 2-3 times the terminate forcefully**
 
*Form Filling Guide (Detailed):*
* **Address Fields:** If address fields are separated (house number, street, city, etc.), fill each field individually.
* **Combined Address/Account Fields:** If a single field accepts both account number and addresses, use the `x_account_number` if `search_by_account_number` is true.
* **Autocomplete Handling:**
    * Wait patiently for autocomplete suggestions.
    * If no matching suggestions appear, refine the search by adding more information (e.g., state).
* **Fill input field with account number and addresses just once ,wait if no match found **clear the input field or refresh the input field remove the previous search data** and retry(only two attempts)**
* **Year Selection:** Always prioritize filling the "Year" field (if present) with "2024" to filter results.
 
*When to Search by account number vs. Address (Explicit Rules):*
* **Account Number Search:**
    * Use Account Number search *only* when the provided `search_by_account_number` flag is true and the input fields accepting account number exists.
