*Primary Objective Statement*:
You will access a county property tax website and search for property details using either an account number or an address (based on search_by_account_number). After identifying the correct property, export the details page as a PDF — only if the address is a perfect match. If no match is found after 2 total attempts, terminate immediately.


**Navigation Steps:
        1.  **Navigate to correct given URL.**
        2.  **Identify and Analyze Form Elements:**
            * Thoroughly examine all form elements, including labels, placeholders, instructions, tooltips, titles, and `aria-label` attributes.
            * Understand the expected input formats and data types for each field.
        3.  **Data Validation and Prioritization (using search_by_account_number):**
            * **Crucially:** Determine the search method based on the `search_by_account_number` flag.
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is true, prioritize searching by `x_account_number`. This is the preferred search method.**
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is false, proceed with address-based search.**
        4.  **Form Filling:**
            * Fill input fields *exactly* as specified by the website's form requirements Fill it just once as it is .
            * Ensure all input fields are filled correctly, including any required Fields
            * Maintain the required formatting (e.g., `##-####`, `####-#-###`).
            * For address searches, initially use only `x_house_number` and `x_street_name`.
            * If a "Year" selection field is available, set it to "2024" first.
            * **Autocomplete Fields:** If an input field uses autocomplete, wait for suggestions to appear after typing. Do not proceed until suggestions are loaded.Type in the address completely , If no relevant suggestions appear, add more filter criteria (e.g., state and zip code) until a match is found.
            **Strictly: Clear the input field refresh the search box  each time  before you start typing account number or address , if you dont find the results in the dropdown  clear refresh and  type it again** 
            **If no result found  by using `search_by_account_number` then clear and refresh input search box field and start trying with address**          
            * **Use the `x_account_number` value for the account number field when `search_by_account_number` is true.**
        5.  **Search and Result Selection:** (Dropdown or Tabular Based):
                    After *filling out the form* and clicking the search button (for form-based UIs), *OR* while *typing* (for autocomplete dropdown UIs), proceed with address validation.
                    Search results may appear as:
                        -A table, list, or search result entries
<<<<<<< HEAD
                        -A dropdown suggestion box while typing address
                        - select search result from any one of the visible results either the table, list or drop down suggestions.
=======
                        -A dropdown suggestion box while typing address or account number select the correct address/account number else select enter

                    **Pre-Click Validation (before selecting any result , Address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address'):**
                        For each result entry (row or dropdown suggestion), compare the following components exactly with the provided fields:
                        Address components that must match exactly:
                            -House number = x_house_number
                            -Street name (including direction/suffixes) = x_street_name
                            -direction = x_direction (eg:E,NW,SW,S,NE...)
                            -City = x_city
                            -State = x_state
                            -ZIP code  = x_zip_code
                    **Only proceed to click/select if all the above fields match exactly(Address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address').Or try to click Enter**
                        -Clear the input field completely or refresh the page.
                        -Re-enter the search criteria (account number or address) exactly as before.
                        -Retry the search one final time.
                        **If no valid match is found even after the second attempt, terminate the task immediately.**
                        **Do not click any unmatched result.**
                    **Post-Click Validation (after selecting a result):(Address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address')**
                        *Once the property details page is loaded, perform a strict and full re-verification of the displayed property address against x_property_address:*
                            -House number = x_house_number
                            -Street name (including direction/suffixes) = x_street_name
                            -direction = x_direction (eg:E,NW,SW,S,NE...)
                            -City = x_city
                            -State = x_state
                            -ZIP code (if shown) = x_zip_code
                        *If the on-page address matches **exactly** and completely, proceed to export the page to PDF.*
                        *If the on-page address does not match exactly*
                            Return to the search results.
                            Attempt a second (and final) valid selection (if the first one was incorrect).
                        After two total attempts, if no correct address is found or selected:
                            *Terminate the task immediately.*
                            Do *not* export any PDF.
                            Do *not* continue further.
                        **After post click if property details and 'x_property_address' doesnot match retry once last time going back to search result**
                        
        6.  **Save page to PDF:(Only if Address is valid and address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address')** 
                *Once the property details page is open and if the address matches perfectly then, 8save the page as a PDF
                If Page contains **2024 Annual Print pdf** just click **Once or maximum two times**
            **Note:** If the *address doesn't match, Terminate the task immediately*
        7.  **End Task.**
        8.  **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**
                *If no results are found in the initial search and if incorrect result is been choosen :*
                    *Retry Search Attempt 2 times* :Clear the input field refresh the page first and then Retry the original search method .
                   
                **If both attempts fail:**
                        -Terminate the task immediately
                **If you are not able to find search box don't keep on looping try 2-3 times the terminate forcefully**


*Form Filling Guide (Detailed):*
* **Address Fields:** If address fields are separated (house number, street, city, etc.), fill each field individually.
* **Combined Address/Account Fields:** If a single field accepts both account number and addresses, use the `x_account_number` if `search_by_account_number` is true.
* **Autocomplete Handling:**
    * Wait patiently for autocomplete suggestions type in the address (eg:house number and street name).
    * If no matching suggestions appear, refine the search by adding more information (e.g., state , zip code).
* **If no results found while `search_by_account_number`then after two attempts try with address**
* **If no results are found after five attempts, terminate the task immediately.**
* **Year Selection:** Always prioritize filling the "Year" field (if present) with "2024" to filter results.
* **Other Fields:** Fill other fields (e.g., property type, owner name) as accurately
* **If state , zipcode is not provided skip it, if it is provided then consider it**

*When to Search by account number vs. Address (Explicit Rules):*
* **Account Number Search:**
    * Use Account Number search *only* when the provided `search_by_account_number` flag is true and the input fields accepting account number exists.
* **Address Search:**
    * Use address search *only* when the provided `search_by_account_number` flag is false or account number input fields does not exists.
***Strict Termination Rules:***
    * Maximum of 3 total attempts (whether dropdown or tabular).
    * Always clear input field between attempts refresh .
    * Do not proceed to export PDF or save pdf  unless the full property address is a confirmed exact match that is Address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address'.
    * Do not loop or retry beyond 2 times — if no match, terminate the task immediately.
