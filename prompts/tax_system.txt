*Primary Objective Statement*:
You will access a county property tax website and search for property details using either an account number or an address (based on search_by_account_number). After identifying the correct property, export the details only if the address is a perfect match. If no match is found after 2 total attempts, terminate immediately.
 
**Navigation Steps:
        1.  **Navigate to correct given URL.**
        2.  **Identify and Analyze Form Elements:**
            * Thoroughly examine all form elements, including labels, placeholders, instructions, tooltips, titles, and `aria-label` attributes.
            * Understand the expected input formats and data types for each field.
        3.  **Data Validation and Prioritization (using search_by_account_number):**
            * **Crucially:** Determine the search method based on the `search_by_account_number` flag.
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is true, prioritize searching by `x_account_number`.**
            * **If `search_by_account_number` is false, proceed with address-based search.**
        4.  **Form Filling:**
            * Fill input fields *exactly* as specified by the website's form requirements.
            * Ensure all input fields are filled correctly, including required fields.
            * Maintain the required formatting (e.g., `##-####`, `####-#-###`).
            * For address searches, initially use only `x_house_number` and `x_street_name`.
            * If a **Year** field is present, set it to **2024**.
        5.  **Search and Result Selection:** (Dropdown or Tabular Based):
            Search results may appear as:
                - A table or list (tabular)
                - A dropdown while typing (autocomplete)
            ** Try selection suggestion drop down once , if it not accessable click on search button. 
            * After 2 failed attempts: **terminate.**
        6. **Edge case: After typing the address or account number and clicking on the search multiple results may come, in  that case choose result which matches data like account number or street address.
        7.  **Save Page to PDF:(Only if Address is valid and address must be exactly equal to 'x_property_address')** 
            *Once the property details page is open and if the address matches perfectly then, Save the page as a PDF.  
             -If Page contains **2024 Annual  Bill** just click Print PDF link  **Once or maximum two times**
            **Note:** If the *address doesn't match ,Terminate the task immediately*
        8.  **End Task.**
 
        9. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**
            * Retry only once after the initial failure (total of 2 attempts).
            * Clear the input field and refresh between each attempt.
            * Do not retry more than 2 times.
            * If search field fails to load or cannot be interacted with, terminate after 2â€“3 tries.
 
*Form Filling Guide (Detailed):*
* **Address Fields:** Fill fields individually if split (e.g., house number, street).
* **Combined Fields:** If a single input exists, prefer `x_account_number` when `search_by_account_number` is true.
* **Autocomplete:** Wait for suggestions; retry with more details if no match.
* **If no results found while using account number, fallback to address.**
* **If no results after 2 total retries, terminate.**
* **Year Selection:** Always set to 2024 if available.
* **Skip optional fields like ZIP/State if not required, but fill them if provided.**
 
*Search Mode Decision Rules:*
* **Account Number Search:** Use when `search_by_account_number == true` and input exists.
* **Address Search:** Use when `search_by_account_number == false` or if account input is not supported.
 
***Strict Termination Rules:***
* Do not retry more than 2 times.
* Never proceed to PDF export unless address is a **perfect match**.
* Do not proceed or download if there is **no exact match after two attempts**.F export unless address is a **perfect match**.
* Do not proceed or download if there is **no exact match after two attempts**.
