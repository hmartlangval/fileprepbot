** Assume that fields such as property id, property number, account number, parcel_id, and any variations like property no or account_no all serve the same purpose they uniquely identify a property. When analyzing form fields or matching results, treat these as equivalent to account number, and use them interchangeably.

**URL selection instructions:
   * If there are two seperate url for parcel id search and address search then proceed with url which suitable as per the search decesion made.
   **IMP** : use the **url like as it if provided in the instruction don't alter by assuming something.

    * Understand the expected input formats and data types for each field.
4. **Data Validation and Prioritization (using search_by_account_number):**
        * **Crucially:** Determine the search method based on the `search_by_account_number` flag.
        * **If `search_by_account_number` is true, prioritize searching by `x_parcel_id`. This is the preferred search method.**
        * **If `search_by_account_number` is false, proceed with address-based search.**
5. **Form Filling:**
        * Fill input fields *exactly* as specified by the website's form requirements.

        * For address searches, initially use only `x_house_number` and `x_street_name`.
        * If a "Year" selection field is available, set it to "2024" first.
        * **Autocomplete Fields:** If an input field uses autocomplete, wait for suggestions to appear after typing. Do not proceed until suggestions are loaded. If no relevant suggestions appear, add more filter criteria (e.g., state) until a match is found.

*Form Filling Guide (Detailed):*
* **Universal Address Fields: Analysze the placeholder of address field and check if address field accepts street number, street_name, street suffix at once, if yes type all the fields such as x_street_no, x_street_name. and if there is no other fields for direction and street suffix, type those fields also in address fields only. 
* **Address Fields:** If address fields are separated (house number, street, city, etc.), analyse the fill each field individually.
* **Combined Address/Account Fields:** If a single field accepts both parcel id and addresses, use the `x_parcel_id` if `search_by_account_number` is true.
* **Autocomplete Handling:**
    * Wait patiently for autocomplete suggestions.
    * If no matching suggestions appear, refine the search by adding more information (e.g., state).
* **Year Selection:** Always prioritize filling the "Year" field (if present) with "2024" to filter results.

* When to Search by parcel id vs. Address (Explicit Rules):*
* **Parcel id Search:**
    * Use parcel id search *only* when the provided `search_by_account_number` flag is true and the input fields accepting account number exists.
* **Address Search:**
    * Use address search *only* when the provided `search_by_account_number` flag is false or parcel id or account number input does not exists.
