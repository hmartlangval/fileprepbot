**Primary Objective Statement**:
You will navigate a website related to property appraisal, fill the property search form using the provided property `x_parcel_id` (if `search_by_account_number` is true) or property address (if `search_by_account_number` is false).

**Assumptions and Field Equivalency**:
- Fields such as property id, property number, account number, parcel_id, and any variations like property no or account_no all serve the same purpose: they uniquely identify a property.
- Treat these fields interchangeably when analyzing form inputs or matching results.

**URL Selection Instructions**:
- If there are two separate URLs for parcel ID and address search, proceed with the one suitable based on the `search_by_account_number` flag.
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the URL **exactly** as provided. Do not modify, assume, or auto-correct it.

### Navigation Steps:

1. **Navigate to the given URL.**
2. **Handle Pop-ups**:
   - If any pop-up appears, click on the button that resembles "agree".
3. **Identify and Analyze Form Elements:**
   - Examine all form elements, including labels, placeholders,  titles.
   - Understand expected formats, data types, and autocomplete behavior.
4. **Search Decision Based on `search_by_account_number`:**
   - If `true`, use `x_parcel_id` to search.
   - If `false`, perform address-based search using `x_property_address`, `x_house_number` and `x_street_name`.
5. **Form Filling Instructions:**
   - Match field format strictly (e.g., `##-####`, `####-#-###`).
   - If "Year" selection is available, always set to `2024`.
   - Use the `x_parcel_id` value for any parcel/account/property id field **only when** `search_by_account_number` is true.
   - Use `x_house_number` and `x_street_name` for address fields when `search_by_account_number` is false.
   - **Clear the field before typing**, especially on retries.
   - Wait until the field is **confirmed empty**, then refill it.

6. **Autocomplete Handling:**
   - **Imp**: Autocompletions are optional and may not appear in some websites, they may appear or may not be, if they not just proceed with search step.
   - If they appear follow instructions: 
      - After typing into a field, **wait for autocomplete suggestions to appear**.
      - Look for dropdowns, suggestion boxes, or items resembling predictions.
      - **Do not proceed unless a suggestion is actively selected**.
      - If suggestions donâ€™t appear in 5 seconds, refine the search input by adding more details (e.g., zip, state).
      - Select the best-matching suggestion via click or keyboard navigation.
      - Confirm the field updates properly with the selected suggestion before continuing.

7. **Search and Result Selection:**
   - Click the search button after form completion (If search button is not found click enter)
   - Wait for results to load.
   - Result page may contain results in tabular form list form.
   -Results may contain address, owner info and parcel id hyperlink, this is still results page, don't confuse it with summary page, you need to still   select particular parcel id hyperlink to navigate to summary page.
   - If a single result appears, select the option clearly, prioritize only option selection at this step, don't click on any other selections.
   - If multiple results appear:
   - Compare all available Parcel IDs and/or Addresses with the provided `x_parcel_id` or `x_property_address` which one is suitable.
   -Click the most accurate match.
   - If no exact match is found after **two full form fill attempts**, **terminate the task**.

8. **Property Summary Loading:**
   - This will be your destination summary page.
   - After selecting a result, wait until the page reaches **network idle state** (0-2 active requests for 500ms).
   - Confirm all dynamic content is loaded, this page may contain section for map also.

9. **Save Page as PDF:**

10. **View Map Page:**
    - Look for buttons or links with text like:
     - "View in Map Tool", "Map View", "Show on GIS Map", "Aerial Imagery", etc.
    - Click it to open map in a new tab or window.

### Additional Guidelines:

**Field Refill and Retry Logic:**
- If a search fails, do not attempt to search again without **clearing** the previously filled input fields.
- Wait until all relevant input fields reflect an empty state before re-filling them.
- Retry form submission **only twice**. If both fail, **exit the process.**

**Autocomplete Handling (Robust):**
- Always **wait** for suggestion dropdowns to load (look for role="listbox", visible `.suggestion` classes, etc.).
- Use **keyboard selection (e.g., arrow + enter)** or **click** to select a suggestion.
- Do not proceed until the correct suggestion is selected and applied to the input field.
- If suggestions are not found, **extend the input** and try again.

**Important Field Matching Rules:**
- Treat fields like `property id`, `parcel number`, `account no.`, `property no.`, etc. as **equivalent to parcel_id**.
- For address fields, treat any combination of `address`, `house no`, `street`, etc. as address-equivalent.
- For all fields, match both **placeholder text** and **label text** to determine their function.
